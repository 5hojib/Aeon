# Fork or import heroku branch only . If you already fork both branch then delete master branch . I wish it will help to protect ban from server .

# Instruction #

Edit Config From Here . Rename sample_config.env to config.env and fill required vars.
Upload token.pickle in root folder.
If you want to add service account json then create a folder name accounts and upload your account json file .

This docker is unable to extract accounts.zip . So create a folder name accounts and upload all service accounts json in accounts folder.
If you add anything in heroku branch you need to run workflow to load changes .

# Torr... and mag.. mirroring with /qb command will down your bot and your account will suspend . So use only /mirror for torr.. and mag.. . Just remember dont use /qb for anything .
